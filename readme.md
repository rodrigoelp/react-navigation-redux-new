# Getting React-Navigation to work with Redux (and typescript)

If you are reading this, you might be trying to get react-navigation to work with redux for the first time OR after they did some breaking changes... Here is my code as a guide as I was also trying to understand what I needed to do.

## What you need

- Typescript compiler as you might need to compile the code to run it.
- Node
- React Native cli

All the code is written (in order) in a single file. This is not the way to organise your code, it was done like that just as a guide.

** Do not run the tests, I have not written tests for this **
